of JavaFX.  It lets one play with the parameters of some basic
fractals and see their effects visually.

The radio buttons select whether your clicks in the 
picture area will zoom in, zoom out, or simply pan the image.
You can also directly change the location and scale in the

The rendering happens across a 4-thread pool for speed.

Update: 10-03-2016 ... added color via the [jfx-palette-designer][1]
I created.
